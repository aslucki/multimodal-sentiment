Filmed on 1/3/16.  Do NOT in any way attempt to recreate something like this.  It is not safe and just because it didn't backfire on me doesn't mean it won't on you.  Read the labels on your fireworks and follow their warnings!\n\n1.  Do you really think that I am killing the \"ocean\" with this when you look at the average polluting by a human each day?  I cleaned up afterward and am also donating $100 to the Milwaukee County Parks System so maybe that will make you feel better.  I chose this spot with safety in mind, finding the one place that couldn't be caught on fire as a result of firing the device.  \n\n2.  Yes, I was initially cited for this but because I turned myself in and have no past record, the citation was removed.  I am also donating $100 to the South Milwaukee police department for their efforts and contributions to the city and its people.\n\n3.  I did this just at sunset rather than at night as I had time restrictions (Packers football).  It was also the only night  I could do it.

He was making a b-line toward me. Humpbacks are graceful and fully aware of their size and of their surroundings, so I wasn't scared (at first) but I was certainly shocked that he chose to swim right up to me. He dove under my kayak, which was amazing and exhilarating! But then his back arched and came to the surface about 3 inches from my boat, which freaked me out a bit. I wondered: hmmm, maybe this one needs contact lenses? Then his enormous barnacle-encrusted tail came out of the water and was about 12 inches from my face, which pretty much made my eyes pop out of my head. So pardon my swearing in the video - I was rather stunned! \n\nAbout a minute later, another whale came up and dove down right next to my friends' kayaks. It was truly unbelievable!  \n\n(Note: we were NOT kayaking toward the whales and it is not advisable - nor is it legal - to do so. It's important to respect whales and just let them be. I think we must have been kayaking atop a huge ball of anchovies since the whales came toward us. Either that or we have serious whale magnetism! :-)",

Granted exclusive access to the world's number one panda research centre and reserve at Chengdu, this film follows the life of a mother and cubs from conception through birth and hand-rearing, to play and young adulthood - and the international team that care for them - over the course of 18 months. With archive footage, the film looks back at the extraordinary East-West collaboration that brought giant pandas back from the brink of extinction, and ahead to the radical, controversial and risky next phase: reintroduction into the wild.\n\nWelcome to BBC EARTH!
